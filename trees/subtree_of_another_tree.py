# 572. Subtree of Another Tree

# Hint
# Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

# A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


# Example 1:


# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: true
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: false


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
# The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# -104 <= root.val <= 104
# -104 <= subRoot.val <= 104

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
