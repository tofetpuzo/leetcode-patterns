# Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

# Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

# Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
# Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
# No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"

# Output: true

# Explanation:

# The bijection can be established as:

# 'a' maps to "dog".
# 'b' maps to "cat".
# Example 2:

# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

# Output: false

# Example 3:

# Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"

# Output: false

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
# pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= s.length <= 3000
# s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
# s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
# All the words in s are separated by a single space.

class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        words = s.split()
        
        # If lengths don't match, no bijection is possible
        if len(pattern) != len(words):
            return False
        
        # Create bidirectional mappings
        char_to_word = {}
        word_to_char = {}
        
        for char, word in zip(pattern, words):
            # Check if char already has a mapping
            if char in char_to_word:
                if char_to_word[char] != word:
                    return False
            else:
                char_to_word[char] = word
            
            # Check if word already has a mapping
            if word in word_to_char:
                if word_to_char[word] != char:
                    return False
            else:
                word_to_char[word] = char
        
        return True
