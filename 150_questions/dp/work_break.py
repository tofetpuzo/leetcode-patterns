# Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

# Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
# Output: false

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 300
# 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
# 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
# s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
# All the strings of wordDict are unique.

        wordSet = set(wordDict)
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = True

        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in wordSet:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break

        return dp[len(s)]
# Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the string s
# Space Complexity: O(n) for the dp array and O(m) for the wordSet
