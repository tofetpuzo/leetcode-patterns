# Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 11

# Output: 3

# Explanation:

# The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 128

# Output: 1

# Explanation:

# The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

# Example 3:

# Input: n = 2147483645

# Output: 30

# Explanation:

# The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
 

# Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += n & 1  # Increment count if the least significant bit is 1
            n >>= 1         # Right shift n to process the next bit
        return count
