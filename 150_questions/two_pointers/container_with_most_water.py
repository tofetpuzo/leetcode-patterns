# Hint
# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

# Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:

# n == height.length
# 2 <= n <= 105
# 0 <= height[i] <= 104

    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:

            # Calculate the width and height of the container
            width = right - left
            h = min(height[left], height[right])
            current_area = width * h
            
            # Update max_area if we found a larger area
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            
            # Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
